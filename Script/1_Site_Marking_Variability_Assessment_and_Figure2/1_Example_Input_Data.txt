% Within- and Between-Subject Variability Analysis of TMS/MT Site Markings
% Prepared by Sanaz Khosravani, PhD 
% Last updated: May 2025

% This script estimates:
% 1. Within-subject variability of site markings: Euclidean distance between each existing session of site marking
%    and the subject-specific averaged site
% 2. Between-subject variability of site markings: Euclidean distance between each existing session of site marking
%    and the group-averaged site
%
% Input Data: Three-dimensional TMS or MT site coordinates in the MNI space for study
% participants
% Output Data: Distance from each session to the averaged site (either within or between)
% 
% To compute within-subject variability data for individuals with > 2 site
% markings, as an alternative to distance from the averaged point, you can use the distance
% to the equidistance point (use 3_Find_Equidistant_Point.mlx).
% ========================================================================

%% Example Data (Replace with actual TMS/MT site coordinates in MNI space)
% Each cell array contains coordinates for one subject
Subject1_SiteMarkings = {[10, 10, 10], [12, 11, 9]};  % Subject with 2 site markings
Subject2_SiteMarkings = {[15, 8, 12]};                % Subject with 1 site marking  
Subject3_SiteMarkings = {[9, 12, 11], [8, 13, 10], [10, 11, 12]}; % Subject with 3 markings

% Combine all subjects' data into one cell array for processing
all_subjects = {Subject1_SiteMarkings, Subject2_SiteMarkings, Subject3_SiteMarkings};

%% Part 1: Within-Subject Variability Analysis
% Calculates for each subject:
% - Centroid (average coordinate) of their site markings
% - Euclidean distance from each site marking to their centroid
% - Averaged distance to be used for within-subject variability assessment

fprintf('=== GENERATING DATA FOR WITHIN-SUBJECT VARIABILITY ANALYSIS ===\n');

subject_centroids = [];  % Stores centroid for each subject
all_markings = [];       % Aggregates all site markings for between-subject analysis

for subj = 1:length(all_subjects)
    % Convert current subject's markings from cell to matrix format
    markings = cell2mat(all_subjects{subj}');
    
    % Calculate subject centroid (averaged coordinate across all their markings)
    subject_centroid = mean(markings, 1);
    subject_centroids = [subject_centroids; subject_centroid];
    
    % Compute Euclidean distance from each marking to subject's averaged point 
    distances = sqrt(sum((markings - subject_centroid).^2, 2));
    
    % Display within-subject variability measure
    fprintf('Subject %d - Mean distance to centroid: %.2f mm\n', subj, mean(distances));
    
end

%% Part 2: Between-Subject Variability Analysis
% Calculates for the entire group:
% - Group centroid (mean of all markings across subjects)
% - Euclidean distance from each marking to group centroid to be used for
% between-subject variability assessment

fprintf('\n=== GENERATING DATA FOR BETWEEN-SUBJECT VARIABILITY ANALYSIS ===\n');

% Re-initialize data (redundant in current script, shown for completeness)
Subject1_SiteMarkings = {[10, 10, 10], [12, 11, 9]};
Subject2_SiteMarkings = {[15, 8, 12]};
Subject3_SiteMarkings = {[9, 12, 11], [8, 13, 10], [10, 11, 12]};
all_subjects = {Subject1_SiteMarkings, Subject2_SiteMarkings, Subject3_SiteMarkings};

% Aggregate all markings from all subjects into one matrix
all_markings = [];
for subj = 1:length(all_subjects)
    markings = cell2mat(all_subjects{subj}');
    all_markings = [all_markings; markings];
end

% Calculate the mean of all site markings
group_centroid = mean(all_markings, 1);

% Compute Euclidean distance from each site marking to group averaged site
between_distances = sqrt(sum((all_markings - group_centroid).^2, 2));

% Display results
fprintf('Group centroid coordinates: [%.2f, %.2f, %.2f]\n', group_centroid);
fprintf('Distances from all markings to group centroid (mm):\n');
disp(between_distances');
